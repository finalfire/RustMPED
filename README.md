# A basic implementation of the MPED in Rust

## Introduction

The Multi-Parameterized Edit Distance is a string metric which allows to compute the minimum edit distance between data streams defined on heterogeneous alphabets, based on the so called concept of _matching schema_ which represents a way to match different symbols, whereas finding the optimal matching schema is part of the problem.
